#### Lecture 1
* syntax and semantics
* scalar objects
* simple operations
* expressions, variables and values

#### Lecture 2
* strings
* branching – if/elif/else
* while loops
* for loops

#### Lecture 3
* while loops vs for loops
* should know how to write both kinds
* should know when to use them
* guess-and-check and approximation methods
* bisection method to speed up programs

#### Lecture 4
* functions
* decomposition – create structure
* abstraction – suppress details
* from now on will be using functions a lot

#### Lecture 5
* tuples - immutable
* lists - mutable
* aliasing, cloning
* mutability side effects

#### Lecture 6
* Recursion – divide/decrease and conquer
  * Factorials, induction, hanoi, fibonacci, palindrome
* Dictionaries - another mutable object type

#### Lecture 7
* Testing
* Debugging

* Assertions


#### Lecture 8
* OO Programming
* abstract data types through classes
* Coordinate example
* Fraction example

#### Lecture 9
* More on classes
  * getters and setters
  * information hiding
  * class variables
